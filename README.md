# Rock Paper Scissors
A simple game which a user plays with computer. There are both console application and GUI(Tkinter) versions for this game.
How it works:
1. User throws his choice (among Rock, Paper, Scissors)
2. The computer program throws a counter to the user randomly.
3. These are taken as input and point is added to the player accorinding to priority.

Game Rules:
-> Rock beats Scissors
-> Scissors beats Paper
-> Paper beats Rock
Same choice is a draw.

Game Modes:
Mode 1: Unlimited 
Here, players keep playing and scores are accordingly added. When the user decides to stop, The one with higher score is declared a winner.
Mode 2: Limited
Here, User can choose the number of rounds(preferebly odd) he wants to play. For example, If the user chooses 5 rounds, the first one to reach 3 points wins.(Best of few type)

Future Scope: Currently this GUI project is just an initial step for the actual future project. I am looking forward to building a computer vision model that works by Hand Gesture Recognition.
