# Rock Paper Scissors
A simple game which a user plays with computer. There are both console application and GUI(Tkinter) versions for this game.

How it works:
1. User throws his choice (among Rock, Paper, Scissors)
2. The computer program throws a counter to the user randomly.
3. These are taken as input and point is added to the player accorinding to priority.

Game Rules:

-> Rock beats Scissors

-> Scissors beats Paper

-> Paper beats Rock

Same choice is a draw.

Game Modes:

Mode 1: Unlimited

Here, players keep playing and scores are accordingly added. When the user decides to stop, The one with higher score is declared a winner.

Mode 2: Limited

Here, User can choose the number of rounds(preferebly odd) he wants to play. For example, If the user chooses 5 rounds, the first one to reach 3 points wins.(Best of few type)

Future Scope: Currently this GUI project is just an initial step for the actual future project. I am looking forward to building a computer vision model that works by Hand Gesture Recognition.
